Displaying the data:

My GUI consists of three scenes
 Scene 1: Prompts the user to play the game
 Scene 2: Prompts the user to setup grid constraints. This is to have some flexibility in testing the system.
 Scene 3: This is the final scene. The user has to click three times to set these initial contraints. These are set
           by the rectangular blocks.


Editing the data:
The user can edit the data in the following way
1. Left-click on mouse once to set the circle
2. Left-click on mouse twice to set the X
3. Left-click on mouse thrice to set the rectangle
4. Left-click more than thrice will clear the tile
5. Once all the entries are made in the Marupeke Grid, the user can click on the submit button
6. Any grid violations will be trigged if the solution has errors

Optional Extras:
I have added three scenes to make it comfortable to the user get familiar with the game in Scene 1 and Scene 2 and
finally in Scene 3, the user is allowed to play the game once the instructions are delivered.

Happy gaming :)
